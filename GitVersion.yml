# You can run
#     GitVersion /showConfig
# to see the effective configuration (defaults + overrides).
#
# See also: https://gitversion.readthedocs.io/en/latest/configuration/
#
# For all branches except dev GitVersion will produce the same
# version NuGet package each commit until you tag a release.
# The base version are calculated from
#   1) next-version in config
#   2) branch name (e.g. release/1.0.0)
#   3) Tagging a commit (tag can be either 1.0.0 or v1.0.0 or v1.0.0-beta5, v.1.0.0-rc1)
# GitVersion v3 has a problematic sorting of tags because it doesn't bump the next version
# of dev (ci builds) until release have been merged into master.
# https://github.com/GitTools/GitVersion/issues/632
# https://github.com/GitTools/GitVersion/issues/695
# This should have been fixed in v4
#
# The sorting should be feature (alpha|a) < develop (ci|dev|beta) < release|hotfix (rc) < master
#
# About Git commit counters: getting a commit counter from git is easy and fast, even for
# very large repos:
#      git rev-list master --count
# or for all commits on a particular branch
#      git rev-list branch ^master --count
