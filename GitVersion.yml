# You can run

# See also: https://gitversion.readthedocs.io/en/latest/configuration/
#
# For all branches except dev GitVersion will produce the same
# version NuGet package each commit until you tag a release.
# The base version are calculated from
#   1) next-version in config
#   2) branch name (e.g. release/1.0.0)
#   3) Tagging a commit (tag can be either 1.0.0 or v1.0.0 or v1.0.0-beta5, v.1.0.0-rc1)
# GitVersion v3 has a problemtic sorting of tags because it doesn't bump the next version
# of dev (ci builds) until release have been merged into master.
# https://github.com/GitTools/GitVersion/issues/632
# https://github.com/GitTools/GitVersion/issues/695
# The sorting should be feature (alpha|a) < develop (cidev|dev|beta) < release|hotfix (rc) < master
